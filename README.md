# :trophy: Code Contests
C4 code contests leverage a community of security researchers and smart contract experts to provide cost effective and rigorous code reviews in a gamified manner. We aim to create a way for both beginners and exceptional white hats to showcase their skills while making DeFi platforms more secure.

Stay up to date with new contests by [following C4 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/code423n4) and [our site](https://code423n4.com).

There are three actors in Code 423n4:

**WARDENS**  
Wardens hunt for bugs in the smart contracts of decentralized protocols.
